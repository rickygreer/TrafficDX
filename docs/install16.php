Now that you have secured the access to your admin area we recommend going through all of the settings that are pointed out by arrows. These areas will already have some default information entered for you, but that is really being provided as an example for you to go by.
<br><br>
After you have everything set to your preferences, we recommend going through the remaining menu items to become more familiar with your new system. There are a lot of things to learn about how your new system operates but don't worry, just spend a little time with it and you will soon become an expert before you know it.
<br><br>
The "Edit Templates" area is where you can customize the look and feel of your new site. Before editing any templates we recommend that you copy and paste what is already there into a text editor such as Notepad in case you need to restore it for some reason.
