PestPatrol Anti-Spyware is a powerful security and personal privacy tool that detects and eliminates destructive pests like trojans, spyware, adware and hacker tools.

-- Remote access trojans (RATs) that allow an attacker to remotely control your computer<br>
-- Keyloggers that can steal passwords and other confidential data<br>
-- Denial-of-service (DoS) attack agents that can crash or hang a program, or your entire system<br>
-- Probe tools that look for vulnerabilities on your system that a hacker can exploit
<br><br>
The easy-to-use interface, automatic updates and extensive on-line research center make it simple to keep your computer clear of unwanted pests.  A 2002 PC Magazine Five Star Utility, PestPatrol makes it easy to surf with confidence, knowing that your personal information stays private and your computer stays secure.

CallerIP scans all the ports on your system and alerts you to any mailicious backdoors or active web services which could provide unauthorized access.
<br><br>
For Windows XP systems the program name is also identified, which helps you determine if the process is legitimate. Harmful backdoors may be installed on your system without your knowledge, possibly disguised as a legitmate program, or by visiting a legitimate website that has been infected by a worm or virus.
<br><br>
Many users then inadvertently allow these programs to access the Internet through their firewall, which enables an attacker to gain access to their system. By monitoring all active connections to and from your system, CallerIP helps identify threats that may not be detected by a firewall. CallerIP should be used in addition to a firewall and anti-virus program for added protection.</p><br><a href="http://store.eSellerate.net/a.asp?c=0_SKU6444323908_AFL1628929826"  target="_blank"><img src="http://www.esellerate.net/images/banners/large_a.gif" border=0 alt="Buy CallerIP"></a>
